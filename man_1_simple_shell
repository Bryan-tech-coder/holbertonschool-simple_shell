.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command line interpreter that reads commands from
standard input and executes them.

It supports command execution with arguments using the PATH
environment variable.

The shell works in both interactive and non-interactive modes.
.SH INTERACTIVE MODE
When executed without arguments, the shell displays a prompt and
waits for the user to enter commands.

Example:
.PP
($) ls
.br
($) pwd
.br
($) exit
.SH NON-INTERACTIVE MODE
Commands can be piped into the shell using standard input.

Example:
.PP
echo "ls" | ./hsh
.SH EXIT STATUS
The shell returns the exit status of the last executed command.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The shell uses the PATH environment variable to locate executable
commands.
